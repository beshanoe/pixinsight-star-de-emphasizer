# Star De-emphasizer Script for PixInsight

### Introdution

This script uses the method of de-empasizing stars suggested by Adam Block (https://adamblockstudios.com/). The basic idea is that we need to create a so-called "halos" mask in order to fill the space around each star with the data from the starless image.

The recommended way to obtain a starless image is by using Starnet++ process. But there are other ways too.

I highly recommend to watch Adam Block's presentation on his method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdSDoJfjM4

### Method

The method consists of the following steps:

1. Get starful image's luminance
2. Apply MultiscaleLinearTransform to it in order to extract structures(stars) of a certain size
3. Apply Binarize process to that
4. Apply MorphologicalTransformation(Dilatio) in order to make binarized stars uniform and round
5. Apply Convolution to smooth dilated stars' edges
6. Substract the luminance image from the convolued image. This way we get a halos mask
7. Apply the starless image to the starful image through the halos mask
8. Enjoy the result or adjust the parameters and retry :)

### Usage

The interface of the script allows you to see how each stage of the process modifies the image.

1. Choose the target image and it's corresponding starless image
1. Select a preview area on the main preview image by clicking the mouse and scrolling to zoom in.
1. Press "Process Preview" button
1. You can press the mouse on the "Result" area to compare the result with the original
1. Adjust parameters and press "Process Preview" again to see the changes some of the stages previews and the resulting image
1. When you're ready, press "Apply" button to start the process on the targetimage
1. Close the script
